# CarND-LaneLines-P1-Submission
SDC Nanodegree - P1 - Lane lines
---
This project uses Canny edge detection & Hough Transforms to find lane lines in several sample images and two videos. The Hough lines are then extrapolated using average gradients and midpoints of the hough lines. This was completed as the first project in the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.
